# The Coder's Conundrum ‚ö°

*A vibe-coded quiz for the nerds, by the nerds. How many can you get right?*

This isn't your average quiz. This is a battle of wits fought with ones, zeros, and a whole lot of developer inside jokes. We built this simple, fun, and slightly sassy quiz app because... why not? It's a tribute to late-night coding sessions, the triumph of finding a missing semicolon, and the eternal question: "Is it a bug or a feature?"

This project is a reminder that coding can be fun, creative, and a little bit weird.

**May your bugs be few and your coffee be strong. Happy quizzing\!**
